<p>as the maquiavel said on his book the prince </p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.pensador.com/frases_de_maquiavel_no_livro_o_principe/">  Therefore, a prince needs to know how to use animals well, and he must take the fox and the lion as examples: for the lion is not capable of defending itself from traps, just as the fox does not know how to defend itself from wolves.</blockquote>
